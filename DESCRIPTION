Description: Methods for spatial transcriptomic analysis based on highly multiplexed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (hm-smFISH) hold particular promise in analysis of complex tissues. Most such methods, however, measure only a panel of genes, which need to be selected in advance to recognize cell types or processes relevant to the tissue being studied. Here, we develop GPS-FISH, a computational method that selects a panel of genes to optimize detection of previously annotated cell types or cell type hierarchies, based on scRNA-seq data. During the gene panel design, we account for platform effects between single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics technologies. In addition, GPS-FISH can incorporate the hierarchical structure of cell types to account for complex cell type relationships. We also provide flexible options for other complex custom preferences.
