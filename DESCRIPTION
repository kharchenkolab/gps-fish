Description: Methods for spatial transcriptomic analysis based on highly
    multiplexed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization
    (hm-smFISH) hold particular promise in analysis of complex tissues.
    Most such methods, however, measure only a panel of genes, which need
    to be selected in advance to recognize cell types or processes
    relevant to the tissue being studied. Here, we develop GPS-FISH, a
    computational method that selects a panel of genes to optimize
    detection of previously annotated cell types or cell type hierarchies,
    based on scRNA-seq data. During the gene panel design, we account for
    platform effects between single cell RNA sequencing and spatial
    transcriptomics technologies. In addition, GPS-FISH can incorporate
    the hierarchical structure of cell types to account for complex cell
    type relationships. We also provide flexible options for other complex
    custom preferences.
